# Analysis-and-optimization
The aim of this repository is to provide codes for various approaches to "optimization problems" which arise in economics, engineering, and the social and physical sciences. Roughly speaking, the problem is to minimize or maximize a given function over a set of variables, satisfying given constraints. Depending of properties of the function and the constraints, there are different methods of solving this problem.

# Methods

* Dantzig's simplex algorithm (or simplex method)
* TBD

NOTE: The methods are based on the lectures of MATH UN2500 -- Analysis and Optimization Spring 2020 by Professor Konstantin Matetski at the Columbia University in the City of New York.
